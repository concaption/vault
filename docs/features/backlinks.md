A backlink for a note is a link from another note to that note. The backlinks section displays all notes that link to the current page, helping you understand relationships between your content and discover connections within your knowledge base.

## How Backlinks Work

Backlinks are automatically generated by analyzing all internal links in your vault. When a page links to another page, the target page will display this incoming link in its backlinks section.

Links in the backlink pane also feature rich [[popover previews]] if you have that feature enabled, allowing you to peek at the referencing content without leaving the current page.

## Benefits of Backlinks

- **Discover connections**: See which notes reference your current topic
- **Navigate contextually**: Follow the natural flow of related thoughts
- **Build knowledge networks**: Identify clusters of related ideas
- **Find gaps**: Spot topics that need more development based on reference patterns

## Example

If you have a note called "Trees" and it's referenced in notes called "Forests", "Botany", and "Carbon Sequestration", the Trees note will show all three of these as backlinks.

## Customization

- **Removing backlinks**: Delete all usages of `Component.Backlinks()` from `quartz.layout.ts`.
- **Hide when empty**: Hide `Backlinks` if given page doesn't contain any backlinks (default is `true`). To disable this, use `Component.Backlinks({ hideWhenEmpty: false })`.
- **Custom title**: Change the heading of the backlinks section with `Component.Backlinks({ title: "Referenced in" })`.
- **Limit entries**: Control the maximum number of backlinks shown with `Component.Backlinks({ limit: 10 })`.
- **Show context**: Display a snippet of text around each backlink with `Component.Backlinks({ showContext: true })`.

## Technical Details

## Enhanced Backlinks

For a more powerful backlinks experience, you can use the [[enhanced-backlinks|Enhanced Backlinks]] component that shows context snippets and better categorizes relationships between notes.
