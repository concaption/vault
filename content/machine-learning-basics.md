# Machine Learning Basics

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of [[artificial-intelligence|Artificial Intelligence]] that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing algorithms that can access data, learn from it, and make predictions or decisions.

## Key Concepts

### Types of Machine Learning

1. **Supervised Learning**
   - Learns from labeled training data
   - Makes predictions based on that data
   - Examples: classification, regression
   - Common algorithms: [[decision-trees]], [[random-forests]], support vector machines, neural networks

2. **Unsupervised Learning**
   - Works with unlabeled data
   - Finds patterns and structures in data
   - Examples: clustering, dimensionality reduction, association
   - Common algorithms: k-means, hierarchical clustering, principal component analysis (PCA)

3. **Reinforcement Learning**
   - Learns optimal actions through trial and error
   - Receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties
   - Used in: robotics, game playing, autonomous systems
   - Examples: Q-learning, Deep Q Networks (DQN)

## The Machine Learning Process

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering relevant data from various sources
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, normalizing, and preparing data
3. **Feature Selection/Engineering**: Identifying or creating the most relevant features
4. **Model Selection**: Choosing the appropriate algorithm for the task
5. **Training**: Teaching the model using training data
6. **Evaluation**: Testing the model's performance on unseen data
7. **Deployment**: Implementing the model in a real-world environment
8. **Monitoring**: Continuously tracking the model's performance

## Common Challenges

- **Overfitting**: Model performs well on training data but poorly on new data
- **Underfitting**: Model is too simple to capture the underlying pattern
- **Data Quality Issues**: Missing values, outliers, or inconsistent formatting
- **Feature Selection**: Determining which variables are most important
- **Computational Resources**: Balancing model complexity with available resources

## Performance Metrics

Different metrics are used depending on the type of problem:

### Classification Metrics
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC Curve and AUC
- Confusion Matrix

### Regression Metrics
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- R-squared

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python**: [[python-for-ml|Python for Machine Learning]]
  - Scikit-learn
  - TensorFlow
  - PyTorch
  - Keras
- **R**: Statistical computing and graphics
- **Julia**: High-performance numerical analysis and computational science

## Applications

Machine learning has found applications in virtually every field:

- Healthcare: Disease diagnosis, drug discovery
- Finance: Fraud detection, algorithmic trading
- Transportation: Self-driving vehicles, traffic prediction
- Entertainment: Recommendation systems, content creation
- Agriculture: Crop yield prediction, automated harvesting
